Contained are the IDL files for taking the output of a standard
reduction and, in the end, producing a set of web pages showing the
throughput of instruments as a function of dispersive element, date
and wavelength.

The LRIS and DEIMOS directories are for the respective instruments.
The DEIMOS one contains Greg Wirth's code.  The LRIS one contains Brad
Holden's adaptation of Greg's code.
