Virtual environments

Using a virtual envirnoment is a useful way of a python installation
that the user can control instead of relying a system level
installation of python.  

Please see the short file Running_with_a_virtualenv for more
information.

Unit Tests

test_run_spec.py and test_run_sens.py test various functions in the
specified modules.  Both rely on the configuration in test_setup.py.
That file specifies the test files and test directories.  test_data/
contains the input files and will contain the output after testing.  

If the tests work, the code will simply print to the screen "success
in" followed by the function name.  Failure will be noted by "failed
in " followed by the function name and the output of the function that
failed.
