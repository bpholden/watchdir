I will assume you have read nothing.

To run this code type:

% python watchdir.py -f configuration_file

% python watchdir.py -w /Volumes/Data1/lris/thru/indir -s /Volumes/Data1/lris_data/thru -c /Volumes/Data1/lris_data/thru/cals -l calibration.list -k /Volumes/Data1/lris_data/thru/ -t 0000_Throughput_standards.list -i /Users/holden/.idlenv3

% python watchdir.py --help 
!!!!!!!
This will list the help, it will give all of the arguments.

watchdir.py is a routine that:

1) watches an input directory for new files (-w --watchdir watchdir aka the DIR that is WATCHed)
2) if the new file is an LRIS fits file that looks like a science frame,
   and the file is observation of a standard star (-k --kroot kroot aka location of /kroot/starlists
    	       		   	    		   -t --starlist starlit aka the starlist of standars, 
						      		 defaults to 0000_Throughput_standards.list)
   it then preps for running the XIDL routine long_reduce
   a) it finds calibration files in the calibration directory (-c --caldir caldir aka the DIR that has the CALibrations,
      	       		   	    		    	       -l --callist callist aka the LIST of CALibrations )
   b) it makes an output directory in the standards directory (-s --stddir stddr aka the DIR that has the STanDards)
   c) it writes a plan file 
   d) it writes a small shell script to execute the IDL (-i --idlenv idlenv aka IDL ENVironment)
3) it runs the IDL code
   a) this processes the observation with the calibrations
   b) the output is a 1-d calibrated spectrum
   c) it compares this output with a standard or fluxed observation
   d) it generates a webpage with a summary of the observation
4) when this is finished, the file is removed from the watch directory

This routine takes eight (8) arguments, which are accessible from

% watchdir.py -h
or 
% watchdir.py --help

1) the directory to watch (defaults to the current working directory)

2) the root directory to place output (defaults to LRIS_THRU, or the
   current working directory)

3) the calibration directory (defaults to the current working
   directory)

4) the ASCII file containing the list of calibrations (generated by
   make_filelist.py, defaults to calibration.list in the calibration
   directory)

5) the total number of XIDL instances to run at once (defaults to 1)

6) the directory containing the star list, this is the list of acceptable stars to use as calibration standards

7) the name of the starlist itself

8) the path of a file that contains the important environment
   variables for IDL.  An example can be found in the src directory and
   it is called "idlenv"
