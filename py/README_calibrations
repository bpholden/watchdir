watchdir.py relies on a directory of calibrations. This is an argument
to watchdir and inside that directory there must be a calibration file list.

* make_filelist.py

Default -c . -l calibration.list

To generate the filelist, use the routine make_filelist.py.
This routine requires two arguments, the imput directory of calibrations and the filename of the output.

% make_filelist.py -c /s/sdata243/lriseng/savior-protected/throughput/calibrations/

which will create the file calibration.list in the above directory
To make a calibration list with a different name, use the -l option

% make_filelist.py -c /s/sdata243/lriseng/savior-protected/throughput/calibrations/ -l new.list


* prep_dirs.py

Default -c . -l calibration.list

The next step is to make the appropriate subdirectories.  This breaks
out each of the calibration files into an appropriate subdirectory.
These will contain files all taken in the same configuration and
camera. 

% prep_dirs.py -c /s/sdata243/lriseng/savior-protected/throughput/calibrations/ -l calibration.list


* reduce_calibrations.py

Default -c . -l calibration.list

This routine runs through the directories make by prep_dirs.py.  In
each subdirectory, the script makes a plan.par file which is used as
input for XIDL.  Running xidl's "long_reduce" in the subdirectory will
process these files.  These files are then used in conjunction with
the standard star observations to construct a sensitivity curve by
watchdir.py.  The script builds a csh script to automate the IDL
processing.

% reduce_calibrations.py -c /s/sdata243/lriseng/savior-protected/throughput/calibrations/ -l calibration.list
