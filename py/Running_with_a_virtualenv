Virtual environments are a way to have a clean python installation
with all of the required dependencies.  This can be built without
needing root access, but required dependencies can be built or
installed in the path of the virtual environment.  Thus, when the user
runs python, the user will have access to all required modules without
having to worry about whether or not the system python has these files.

Using a virtual environment.

To run a program under the virtual environment, you will need to do the following.
If sh or bash is not your native shell:

% cd virtual_environment
% bash
$ source bin/activate
$ python program.py

If sh or bash is your native shell,

$ cd virtual_environment
$ source bin/activate
$ python program.py
